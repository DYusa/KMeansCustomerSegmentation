# KMeansCustomerSegmentation
This repository demonstrates customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on a dataset containing customer attributes from: https://www.kaggle.com/code/heeraldedhia/kmeans-clustering-for-customer-data.

## Features  
- **Elbow Method Analysis**:  
  - Determines the optimal number of clusters using the inertia metric to ensure effective segmentation.  

- **2D and 3D Visualizations**:  
  - Displays cluster boundaries and customer distribution using matplotlib and Plotly.  

- **Customizable Clustering**:  
  - Easily adjustable clustering parameters, including the number of clusters, initialization methods, and algorithm configurations.  

- **Interactive 3D Visualization**:  
  - Provides an interactive 3D view of customer segmentation using Plotly for better interpretability.  

## Project Overview  
1. **Elbow Plot**:  
   - Analyze inertia values across different cluster numbers to identify the optimal cluster count.  

2. **2D Visualization**:  
   - Visualize customer clusters with clear decision boundaries using matplotlib.  

3. **3D Visualization**:  
   - Interact with a 3D scatter plot of customer clusters based on Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
